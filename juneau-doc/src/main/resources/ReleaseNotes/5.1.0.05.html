5.1.0.5 (Sept 1, 2014)

<p>
	Juno 5.1.0.5 is a moderate update.
</p>
<ul class='spaced-list'>
	<li>New <code><del>Redirect</del></code> class that simplifies performing redirections in REST methods.
	<li>New pluggable {@link org.apache.juneau.rest.ResponseHandler} class and {@link org.apache.juneau.rest.annotation.RestResource#responseHandlers() @RestResource.responseHandlers()} annotation
		for defining customer response handlers for special kinds of POJOs.
	<li>New method <del><code>UrlEncodingSerializer.serializeUrlPart(Object)</code></del> method.
	<li>New method <code><del>RestRequest.getServletURIBuilder()</del></code> for construcing servlet-based URLs more efficiently.
	<li>New method {@link org.apache.juneau.rest.RestResponse#getNegotiatedOutputStream()} that uses encoders if a match is found, 
		and {@link org.apache.juneau.rest.RestResponse#getOutputStream()} that just return the underlying output stream without any modifications.
	<li>Fixed bug where some properties were not being propagated correctly when using <code><del>CoreObject.setProperties(ObjectMap)</del></code>
		on serializer and parser subclasses.
	<li>Fixed bug in {@link org.apache.juneau.html.HtmlSerializer} where URL keys in Maps were not being serialized as hyperlinks.
	<li>Fixed bug in {@link org.apache.juneau.json.JsonSerializer} where <js>"_class"</js> and <js>"items"</js> attributes were not quoted in strict mode when using SERIALIZER_addClassAttrs feature.	
	<li>Fixed bug where <code>Content-Encoding</code> and<code>Character-Encoding</code> headers were being set when calling {@link org.apache.juneau.rest.RestResponse#getOutputStream()}.
		These should not be set if interacting with the output streams at a low level.
	<li>Eliminated various convenience <code>RestResponse.sendRedirect(...)</code> methods due to the introduction of the <code><del>Redirect</del></code> class.
</ul>
