<p>
	Juno 5.1.0.9 is a major update.
	There weren't very many code changes, but the source has been made a part of Jazz Foundation.
	This required some restructuring of the project.
	The project on Jazz Hub will eventually be discontinued.
	However, the libraries on IBM Community Source will continue to be updated regularly.
