5.1.0.8 (Oct 25, 2014)

<p>
	Juno 5.1.0.8 is a moderate update, focused primarily on performance improvements.
</p>
<ul class='spaced-list'>
	<li>Improved performance on JSON and URL-Encoding parsers by approximately 50% on large data sets. 
		<ul>
			<li>Rewrote {@link org.apache.juneau.parser.ParserReader} class to handle it's own buffering.
				The change allowed several optimizations to be made when dealing with JSON and URL-Encoding
				text by avoiding char array copies.  
			<li>Added a <code>estimatedSize</code> parameter to the {@link org.apache.juneau.parser.Parser} parse methods to 
				optimize buffering when the input size is known beforehand.
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Revamped the {@link org.apache.juneau.BeanContext} API to perform better in multi-threaded environments.
		<ul>
			<li>Introduced a new <code>BeanPropertyStore</code> class that handles creation of {@link org.apache.juneau.BeanContext} objects.
				This allows <code>BeanContext</code> objects to be considered immutable, and therefore cacheable/reusable by the framework.
				While this was technically possible to cache these objects beforehand, it relied on a locking mechanism to prevent bean contexts
					from being modified after being created.  The new mechanism is much more straightforward.
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Modifications to the <del>org.apache.juneau.rest.client</del> APIs to make it easier to work with custom Apache HTTP clients.
		<ul>
			<li>Added overridable <code><del>RestClient#createHttpClient()</del></code> to allow customized subclasses to construct customized HTTP clients.
			<li>Removed the <code>DefaultRestClient</code> class since it's now fully redundant with <code>RestClient</code>.
			<li>Added <code>RestClient.shutdown()</code> method for cleaning up the internal HTTP client when you're done using a REST client.
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
