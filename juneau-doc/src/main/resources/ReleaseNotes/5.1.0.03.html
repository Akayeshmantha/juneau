5.1.0.3 (Jun 28, 2014)

<p>
	Juno 5.1.0.3 is a moderate update.
</p>

<h5 class='topic w800'>Core API updates</h5>
<ul class='spaced-list'>
	<li>Ability to detect and use non-public bean classes, getters/setters, and fields using the following new properties:
		<ul>
			<li>{@link org.apache.juneau.BeanContext#BEAN_beanConstructorVisibility} - Control which bean constructors are visible to Juno.
			<li>{@link org.apache.juneau.BeanContext#BEAN_beanClassVisibility} - Control which bean classes are interpreted as beans to Juno.
			<li>{@link org.apache.juneau.BeanContext#BEAN_beanFieldVisibility} - Control which fields are visible to Juno as bean properties.
			<li>{@link org.apache.juneau.BeanContext#BEAN_beanMethodVisibility} - Control which getters/setters are visible to Juno as bean properties.
		</ul>
		Removed <code>BeanContext.<jsf>INCLUDE_BEAN_FIELD_PROPERTIES</jsf></code> and <code>BeanContext.<jsf>INCLUDE_BEAN_METHOD_PROPERTIES</jsf></code> properties, since ignoring fields and methods
		can be accomplished by setting the appropriate properties above to {@link org.apache.juneau.Visibility#NONE NONE}.
		Also, the {@link org.apache.juneau.annotation.BeanProperty @BeanProperty} annotation can now be used on non-public fields/getters/setters to override
		the default behavior defined by the <code>VISIBILITY</code> properties identified above.  This is a convenient way of identifying protected or
		private fields or methods as bean properties.  Previously, you could only identify public fields/getters/setters using this annotation.
	</li>
	<li>New {@link org.apache.juneau.BeanContext#BEAN_useJavaBeanIntrospector} property that lets Juno use the Java bean <code>Introspector</code>
		class to determine bean properties.  In the previous release, the method for determining bean properties was a mixture of Juno-based and Introspector-based.
		Now it's either pure Juno-based or pure Introspector-based.  The result is considerably cleaner code and consistent behavior.
	<li>New {@link org.apache.juneau.annotation.BeanIgnore @BeanIgnore} annotation.  Replaces the previous <code><ja>@BeanProperty</ja>(hidden=<jk>true</jk>)</code> annotation
		for ignoring bean properties.  Can also be used on classes that look like beans so that they're not treated as beans.
	<li>Support for parsing into non-static member classes.  This applies to all parsers.
	<li>New {@link org.apache.juneau.json.annotation.Json#wrapperAttr() @Json.wrapperAttr()}	annotation that automatically wraps beans and objects in a wrapper
		attribute when serializing to or parsing from JSON.
	<li>Changed the default ordering of bean properties to be in parent-to-child class order.
	<li>New {@link org.apache.juneau.transform.BeanFilter#readProperty(Object,String,Object) readProperty()} and {@link org.apache.juneau.transform.BeanFilter#writeProperty(Object,String,Object) writeProperty()}
		methods added to {@link org.apache.juneau.transform.BeanFilter} class to allow individualized serialization and parsing behavior on a class-by-class basis.
	<li>Eliminated previous restriction where bean subtype attributes had to be listed first in JSON objects when using the <code><del>Bean.subTypeProperty()</del></code> annotation.
		The previous behavior was not strictly JSON-compliant since JSON objects are supposed to consist of unordered lists of key/value pairs.
		While targeted for JSON, the restriction is also lifted for all other parsers.  	
	<li>New fluent-style {@link org.apache.juneau.BeanMap#load(String) BeanMap.load()} methods for initializing bean maps.
	<li>{@link org.apache.juneau.html.HtmlDocSerializer} will now embed the data portion of the output in a <code><xt>&lt;div</xt> <xa>id</xa>=<xs>'data'</xs><xt>&gt;</xt></code> element to make it easier to extract the data portion of the page in Javascript in browsers.
</ul>

<h5 class='topic w800'>REST Server API updates</h5>
<ul class='spaced-list'>
	<li>New {@link org.apache.juneau.rest.RestRequest#getJavaMethod()} method for getting access to the method used to handle a request.
		Useful for accessing the method name or annotations during requests, such as in calls to {@link org.apache.juneau.rest.RestGuard#guard(RestRequest,RestResponse)}.
	<li>Fixed bug when using Jetty where you tried to read text input after a header was written.
	<li>Added new string variables <code><del>$A{...}</del></code> (request attributes) and <code><del>$P{...}</del></code> (request parameters) to <code>RestServlet.createRequestVarResolver(RestRequest)</code>.
</ul>
