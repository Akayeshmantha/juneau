{todo} Method Return Types

<p>
	The return type of the Java methods of 3rd-party proxies can be any of the following:
</p>
<ul class='spaced-list'>
	<li>
		<jk>void</jk> 
		- Don't parse any response.  
		<br>Note that the method will still throw a runtime exception if an error HTTP status is returned.
	<li>
		Any {@doc PojoCategories parsable} POJO 
		- The body of the response will be converted to the POJO using the parser defined on the 
		<code>RestClient</code> based on the <code>Content-Type</code> of the response.
	<li>
		Any {@link org.apache.juneau.http.annotation.Response @Response}-annotated type. (described below)
	<li>
		<code>HttpResponse</code> 
		- Returns the raw <code>HttpResponse</code> returned by the inner <code>HttpClient</code>.
	<li>
		{@link java.io.Reader} 
		- Returns access to the raw reader of the response.
		<br>Note that if you don't want your response parsed as a POJO, you'll want to get the response reader 
		directly.
	<li>
		{@link java.io.InputStream} 
		- Returns access to the raw input stream of the response.
</ul>
