@Remoteable Annotation

<p>
	What if you want fine-tuned control over which methods are exposed in an interface instead of just all public 
	methods?
	<br>For this, the {@link org.apache.juneau.remoteable.Remoteable @Remoteable} annotation is provided.
	<br>It can be applied to individual interface methods to only expose those methods through the remoteable servlet.
</p>
<p>
	For example, to expose only the first 2 methods in our <code>IAddressBook</code> interface...
</p>
<p class='bcode w800'>
	<jk>public interface</jk> IAddressBook {
		<ja>@Remoteable</ja> Person createPerson(CreatePerson cp) <jk>throws</jk> Exception;
		<ja>@Remoteable</ja> Person findPerson(<jk>int</jk> id);
		Address findAddress(<jk>int</jk> id);
		Person findPersonWithAddress(<jk>int</jk> id);
	}
</p>	
<p>
	On the server side, the option to restrict access to only annotated methods is defined through a property:
</p>
<p class='bcode w800'>
	<ja>@RestResource</ja>(
		path=<js>"/remoteable"</js>,
		properties={
			<jc>// Only expose methods annotated with @Remoteable.</jc>
			<ja>@Property</ja>(name=<jsf>REMOTEABLE_includeOnlyRemotableMethods</jsf>, value=<js>"true"</js>)
		}
	)
	<jk>public class</jk> SampleRemoteableServlet <jk>extends</jk> RemoteableServlet {
</p>
<p>
	The <ja>@Remoteable</ja> annotation can also be applied to the interface class to expose all public methods 
	defined on that interface.
</p>
<p class='bcode w800'>
	<ja>@Remoteable</ja>
	<jk>public interface</jk> IAddressBook {
		Person createPerson(CreatePerson cp) <jk>throws</jk> Exception;
		Person findPerson(<jk>int</jk> id);
		Address findAddress(<jk>int</jk> id);
		Person findPersonWithAddress(<jk>int</jk> id);
	}
</p>
