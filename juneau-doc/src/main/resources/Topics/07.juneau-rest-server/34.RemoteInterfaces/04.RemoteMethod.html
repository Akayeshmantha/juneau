{todo} @RemoteMethod Annotation

<p>
	What if you want fine-tuned control over which methods are exposed in an interface instead of just all public 
	methods?
	<br>For this, the {@link oajrc.remote.RemoteMethod @RemoteMethod} annotation is provided.
	<br>It can be applied to individual interface methods to only expose those methods through the remote interface servlet.
</p>
<p>
	For example, to expose only the first 2 methods in our <code>IAddressBook</code> interface...
</p>
<p class='bpcode w800'>
	<jk>public interface</jk> IAddressBook {
		<ja>@RemoteMethod</ja> Person createPerson(CreatePerson cp) <jk>throws</jk> Exception;
		<ja>@RemoteMethod</ja> Person findPerson(<jk>int</jk> id);
		Address findAddress(<jk>int</jk> id);
		Person findPersonWithAddress(<jk>int</jk> id);
	}
</p>
