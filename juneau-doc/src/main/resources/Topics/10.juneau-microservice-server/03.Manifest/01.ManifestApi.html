<p>
	The {@link org.apache.juneau.microservice.Microservice#getManifest()} method is a static method that
	can be used to retrieve the manifest file as a {@link org.apache.juneau.utils.ManifestFile}.  
</p>
<p class='bcode w800'>
	<jc>// Get Main-Class from manifest file.</jc>
	String mainClass = Microservice.<jsm>getInstance</jsm>().getManifest().getString(<js>"Main-Class"</js>, <js>"unknown"</js>);
</p>

	The {@link org.apache.juneau.utils.ManifestFile} class extends {@link org.apache.juneau.ObjectMap},
	making it possible to retrieve entries as a wide variety of object types such as java primitives, arrays, collections, 
	maps, or even POJOs serialized as JSON.
