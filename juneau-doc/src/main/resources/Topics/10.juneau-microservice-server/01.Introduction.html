Microservice Introduction

<p>
	The Microservice API consists of a combination of the Juneau Core, Server, and Client APIs and an embedded
	Eclipse Jetty Servlet Container.  
	<br>It includes all libraries needed to execute in a Java 1.7+ environment.
</p>
<p>
	Features include:
</p>
<ul class='spaced-list'>
	<li>
		An out-of-the-box zipped Eclipse project to get started quickly.
	<li>
		Packaged as a simple executable jar and configuration file.
	<li>
		All the power of the Juneau ecosystem for defining REST servlets and clients with the ability to 
		serialize and parse POJOs as HTML, JSON, XML, RDF, URL-Encoding, and others.
	<li>
		An extensible API that allows you to hook into various lifecycle events.
	<li>
		Simple-to-use APIs for accessing manifest file entries, command-line arguments, and external configuration 
		file properties.
	<li>
		Predefined REST resources for configuring microservice and accessing log files.
</ul>
<p>
	The <code>juneau-microservice-server</code> library consists of the following classes:
</p>
<ul class='doctree'>
	<li class='jac'>
		{@link org.apache.juneau.microservice.Microservice} 
		- Defines basic lifecycle methods for microservices in general.
		<ul>
			<li class='jc'>
				{@link org.apache.juneau.microservice.RestMicroservice}
				- Defines additional lifecycle methods for REST microservices.
				<br>Starts up an externally-configured Jetty server, registers servlets, and sets up 
				other features such as logging.  
		</ul>
</ul>
