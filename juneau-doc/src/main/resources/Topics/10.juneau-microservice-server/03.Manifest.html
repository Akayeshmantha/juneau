Manifest File

<p>
	The generated <l>META-INF/MANIFEST.MF</l> file is used to describe the microservice. 
	<br>If you open it, you'll see the following:
</p>
<p class='bcode w800'>
	<mk>Main-Class</mk>: <mv>org.apache.juneau.microservice.RestMicroservice</mv>
	<mk>Main-ConfigFile</mk>: <mv>my-microservice.cfg</mv>
<p>
 	The <mk>Main-Class</mk> entry is the standard manifest entry describing the entry point for the executable jar.
 	<br>In most cases, this value will always be <l>org.apache.juneau.microservice.RestMicroservice</l>.
 	<br>However, it is possible to extend this class or implement your own microservice, in which case you'll need
 	to modify this value to point to the new class.
</p>
<p>
	The <mk>Main-ConfigFile</mk> entry points to the location of an external configuration file for our microservice.
</p>		
<p>
	In addition to these predefined manifest entries, you can add your own particular entries to the manifest file
	and access them through the Manifest API described next. 
</p>
